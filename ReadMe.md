# PERT Analysis

This tool is used to find the critical path and total time required to complete all tasks.

## Process

Previous task is linked to all tasks. There can be multiple previous tasks. Once all tasks and their estimate are created then all tasks are evaluated for time to start and stop the task. This helps find what is critical path and where we have some spare time.
